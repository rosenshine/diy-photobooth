# diy photobooth

When we were getting ready for our wedding, we made our own photobooth with a raspberry pi. People took a bunch of great photos, but after the wedding we couldn't find an easy tool to stitch them together into a strip like a real photobooth. This tool lets you skip the command line editing and add some filters to boot.
